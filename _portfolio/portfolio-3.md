Developed non-sacrificial layer processes to enable enhanced optical sensor functionality.

**Key outcome**
- Achieved double-digit yield improvement by validating non-sacrificial layer integration
- Improved backside quality by reducing PI backside ash and carrier-glass scratches
- Established uniform LLO exposure by optimizing laser parameters and mitigating scratch-induced laser blocking
