Investigated viewing angle color shift defects and optimized panel processes to improve uniformity and yield.

**Key outcome**
- Identified CVD encapsulation thickness as a key driver of VACS defects
- Reduced line-to-line and chamber-to-chamber VACS defect variation
- Improved inline and cell-level inspection consistency through CVD thickness optimization
