Developed via etch processes to achieve target etch profiles. 

**Key outcome**
- Achieved target via profiles with increased metal volume while preserving bottom CD
- Maintained leakage margin by suppressing bottom CD enlargement
- Improved plasma process stability by eliminating arcing through optimized duty cycle control
