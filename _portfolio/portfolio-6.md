Analyzed ESD failure mechanisms and implemented process improvements to reduce defects and improve yield.

**Key outcome**
- Eliminated the ESD defect spike and stabilized yield
- Established dielectric thickness as a key ESD control parameter
- Enabled proactive defect prevention through automated thickness monitoring
